# MATLAB Fall 2015 â€“ Research Plan 


> * Group Name: traffic
> * Group participants names: Sebastian Honegger, Filip Meier
> * Project Title: Sihlstrasse

## General Introduction

The city of Zurich planing to change one specific part of the sihlstrasse in a pedestrian area. The idea is to make this area more comfortable for the visitors of the city center and it should be also an upgrade for the restaurants and shops around this area.
The changement will have a big impact for the traffic because there will be one track less than before.
Our goal will be to analize the impact for the traffic in this area and the neigbourhood streets. We want to simulate the highest volume of traffic for this new street situation with one track less.

The question is that we want to know if this changement increase the traffic jam for this area and what is the impact for the neigbourhoodstreets.

## The Model

We want to simulate the traffic for this area with the traffic lights. We will work with datalist from the city of zurich, they analized the traffic jam peaks at working days. We are not yet sure which modell is the best for this specific simulation.
We think to simulate it with:
- the classical urban transportation planning system
- Nagel-Schreckenberg-Model
- others...

## Fundamental Questions

First of all the goal is for us to understand the classical urban transportation planning system/Nagel-Schreckenberg-Model, and that we get a good simulation of the traffic.
The question which we want to have answered are:
- Is the street still large enough for highest number of cars per hour?
- What is the impact to the neigbourhood streets? Traffic jam etc.?
- Which area or signal light is the bottleneck?

## Expected Results

We expect an increase of traffic jam in the neigbourhood streets. That means the neigbourhood areas will have more traffic pressure than before. We also predict that it should give a shift of traffic jam which is depended of the bottle neck.

## Other

We will use the dataset from www.stadt-zuerich.ch/tiefbauamt, which gives us the numbers of cars per hour at the traffic jam peaks.
